# NFT sniper!!! NFT HUNTER
## Download all NFT metadata from a collection then find the rarest ones, in aaa reasonable time...

but of course there is no such thing as free and easy money lmao so this **DID NOT WORK**. 
The so called 'rare' NFTs were priced higher than the other items in the collection, defeating the whole purpose of hunting the rarest NFT-s automatically.
A waste of time, but the _real one piece_ in developing this app was the friends I've made on the way ;) ♠️
